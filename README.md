Rutgers Data Sciences Bootcamp, Project 1 (10 April 2023)

In this group project, we took data for Heart Disease and Stroke Mortality in the US from 1999 to 2019 to discover the progress the US has made as a country, how regions and individal states did. To break it down even further, we chose to go down to the local county level and selected New Jersey for it diversity and see whether location, population, and poverate rate can play some role, so we pull in data from the US Census API to help us generate this missing data from our dataset.

We first cleaned our dataset and then get down to breaking the data.  What we come find from a country level, regional/state level, and county (NJ) level is that the data for Heart Disease and Stroke Mortality trends downward from 1999 to 2019 which we can assume at this point is due to the increase in health education in areas such as tobacco, diabetes, and obesity.  Therefore, we bring in another dataset and clean it, and attempt to find a correlation between our original dataset and these other related conditions.
